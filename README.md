For this project, I will be using what I have learned so far to create a playable rock paper siccors game against a computer. I will be using DOM manipulation through javescript and lots of css edits.


update 3/6/2022.

i have came back to this project to add a "show hand text sign" so the user knows what hand sign was used by the player and the computer.
